    <img src="https://preppykitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/caramel-cake-feature-2.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This moist, fluffy caramel cake has layers of vanilla yellow cake covered in homemade salted caramel and creamy
        caramel-infused Swiss meringue buttercream; it will set your heart aflutter! It's one of the most delicious
        things I've made and I love the simple decoration scheme of stripes, a caramel drip.</p>

        <li>1 1/2 cups sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1 cup cream</li>
        <li>5 tbsp butter unsalted</li>
        <li>1/2 salt</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    <h4>For the frosting</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>5 egg whites large</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups sugar</li>
        <li>1 pound butter room temp</li>
        <li>1/3 cup caramel</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>
    <h4>For the cake</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter and flour three 6 inch round pans. Whisk together the flour, baking
            powder and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Mix vinegar and milk in a small bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cream butter and sugar in a stand mixer using a paddle attachment. </li>
        <li>Add vanilla and eggs one at a time mixing until incorporated before adding the next. Scrape the bowl down.
        </li>
        <li>Add flour and milk mixtures to the butter in alternating batches. </li>
        <li>Bake at 350F for about 30 minutes or until the centers are set and springy.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
    <h4>For the caramel</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the sugar and water into a medium saucepan and stir until sugar is dissolved. Place over medium-high
            heat and brush the inside of the pot with a wet pastry brush so crystals do not form.</li>
        <li>Cook until sugar mixture becomes a golden amber color, then remove from heat and whisk in the cream
            vigorously. Add butter and bring back to a medium low heat. Continue whisking and cook for an additional 2-3
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix in salt, transfer to a bowl and set aside to cool to room temperature. Caramel can be made in advance
            and refrigerated.
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
    <h4>For the frosting</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together egg whites and sugar in a glass bowl. Set over a pot of simmering water making sure the water
            doesn't touch the bowl.</li>
        <li>Whisk over hear until a thermometer reads 165F. Transfer mixture to a stand mixer fitted with a whisk
            attachment and mix on high for a few minutes then stitch to medium low until room temp.</li>
        <li>Switch to a paddle attachment and add butter a tablespoon at a time. Reserve about a cup and a half of the
            frosting.</li>
        <li>Add about 1/3 a cup of caramel to the large batch of frosting and another 1/3 a cup to the small batch. You
            can add more caramel and salt to taste but it is important for the two batches of frosting to have a visible
            contrast.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
    <h4>For the assembly</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Drizzle caramel onto the fist layer then add a layer of buttercream. Place second layer on top and repeat
            the process until cake is three layers tall.
        </li>
        <li>Cover cake in buttercream and smooth. Use a cake comb to cut grooves into the side then chill the cake.</li>
        <li>Pipe the darker caramel buttercream into the grooves and smooth so stripes show up.</li>
        <li>Add a layer of caramel onto the top of the cake and smooth. You can add additional drips onto the side if
            needed.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle flaked sea salt onto the top of the cake and serve.</li>
    </ol>
