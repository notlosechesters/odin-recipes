    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500g / 1 lb chicken breast, boneless and skinless (2 pieces)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup flour </li>
        <li>3 1/2 tbsp (50g) unsalted butter (or 2 1/2 tbsp olive oil)</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp apple cider vinegar (or white or other clear vinegar)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp soy sauce, light or all purpose</li>
        <li>1/3 cup honey (or maple syrup)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the breasts in half horizontally to create 4 steaks in total. Sprinkle each side with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Place flour in a shallow dish. Coat chicken in flour and shake off excess.</li>
        <li>Melt most of the butter in a large skillet over high heat – hold back about 1 tsp for later.</li>
        <li>Place chicken in skillet and cook for 2 – 3 minutes until golden. Turn and cook the other side for 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>Turn heat down slightly to medium high.</li>
        <li>Make a bit of room in the pan and add garlic and top with remaining dab of butter. Stir garlic briefly once
            butter melts.</li>
        <li>Add vinegar, soy sauce and honey. Stir / shake pan to combine. Bring sauce to simmer, then simmer for 1
            minute or until slightly thickened.</li>
        <li>Turn chicken to coat in sauce. If the sauce gets too thick, add a touch of water and stir.</li>
        <li>Remove from stove immediately. Place chicken on plates and drizzle over remaining sauce.</li>
    </ol>
